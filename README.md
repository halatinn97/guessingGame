### Description:

A number guessing game that lets you guess numbers from 0-99. The numbers are randomized and therefore allow for the player to play as many times as wished. The player can enter the guess in the input field and will get a message that reacts to the input, and tells the user the mystery number is either higher, lower or correct. Once the game is lost or won, the game will end automatically and can be restarted with a refresh of the page. 

### Purpose:
